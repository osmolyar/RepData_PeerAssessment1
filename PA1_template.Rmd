## Loading and preprocessing the data
activitydf<-read.csv("activity/activity.csv")


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
totals<-tapply(activitydf$steps,activitydf$date,sum,na.rm=TRUE)
hist(totals)
mean(totals)
median(totals)
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
intervalmeans<-tapply(activitydf$steps,activitydf$interval,mean,na.rm=TRUE)


## Imputing missing values
plot(names(intervalmeans),intervalmeans,type="l")
which.max(intervalmeans)

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
